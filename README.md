# Genesis: Project Proposals

Welcome to **Genesis**. This repository is where new project ideas for the **SUDO (Society of Unified Developers and Operators)** are proposed, discussed, and initiated.

Our goal at SUDO is to collaboratively build foundational software from the ground up, emphasizing deep understanding and practical skill. Genesis is the starting point for these efforts.

For more about SUDO's philosophy, see our [main SUDO README](https://github.com/sudonitj/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).

## How Genesis Works

1.  **Propose an Idea:**
    *   If you have an idea for a new library, tool, or application that fits SUDO's "build from scratch" and foundational approach, this is the place to share it.
    *   First, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/sudonitj/genesis/issues) to see if your idea has already been proposed.
    *   If not, [**open a new issue**](https://github.com/sudonitj/genesis/issues/new?template=project_proposal.md&title=Proposal%3A+Your+Project+Name) using the "Project Proposal" template.

2.  **Discuss and Refine:**
    *   Once an idea is proposed, community members and SUDO core contributors will discuss it in the issue comments.
    *   The focus will be on its alignment with SUDO principles, feasibility, and educational value.
    *   The proposal can be updated based on feedback.

3.  **Gather Interest / Form a Team: (optional)**
    *   A key goal of the discussion is to see if others are interested in contributing to or leading the project.
    *   If there's enough interest and the project aligns well, it can move forward.

4.  **Launch the Project:**
    *   Once a proposal is well-defined and has initial contributors, a dedicated new repository will be created for it under the SUDO organization (e.g., `sudo-lib-networking`).
    *   The team can then start development in that new repository.
    *   The original Genesis issue will be updated with a link to the new project repository and then closed.

## What to Include in Your Proposal

When you open an issue for a new project idea, try to cover:

*   **Project Goal:** What will the project do? What problem does it solve?
*   **SUDO Alignment:** How does it fit SUDO's philosophy of building foundational software?
*   **Core Features:** What are the essential parts of a first version?
*   **Why SUDO should build it:** What's the benefit to the community or to learning?

## Getting Involved

*   Review current [project proposals (issues)](https://github.com/sudonitj/genesis/issues).
*   Participate in discussions on existing proposals.
*   Submit your own project ideas.
*   Connect on the SUDO Discord Server for live discussions.

This process helps us ensure new projects are well-considered, aligned with SUDO's mission, and have community support before development begins.
